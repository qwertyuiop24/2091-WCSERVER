    <h2>ANGELES CITY: A Place of Culture, Food and Discoveries</h2>
    <p>
      Angeles City - is a place so familiar to many, yet most of its treasures
      remain undiscovered. While the place is famous for its red light district
      and the no-fail favorite sizzling sisig, I came to realize that thereâ€™s
      more to Angeles city than what most people know. My 3-day stay in this
      interesting place can attest to that. Beyond the flickering city lights of
      this modern metropolis lies a profound history and rich culture. The Museo
      Ning Angeles, Bale-Balayan, Pamintuan Mansion, and the Holy Rosary Parish
      Church are some of the existing testaments to the heritage and culture
      deeply rooted in the veins of Angeles.
